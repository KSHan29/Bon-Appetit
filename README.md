# Project scope

A mobile application that allows consumers to collates food delivery orders thus reducing delivery fees.

The application will be built using mainly React Native and JavaScript with the help of third party libraries. Backend database will also be used to manage user information.

# Problem motivation

With the rise in costs, food delivery prices have skyrocketed over the years. This comes at a time where consumers work from home more often thus food delivery can bring great convenience for them. Thus, we want to develop a mobile application that allows users to collate orders and lower their delivery fees while not comprimising on the earnings of delivery riders.

# Proposed core features

1. Connect account to gmail / facebook and wallet to GrabPay
2. Join existing group orders if they wish to buy from the same restaurant as others. They can also make a new group order (30mins, up to 24 hours later - minimum of 30 mins so that sufficient time for other users to opt to join) to buy from the restaurant they want and wait for others to join to lower the delivery fee
3. Users can set the maximum price they are willing to pay for delivery so that the order automatically goes through if the price they are willing to pay is higher than the delivery fee. If the delivery fee is higher than what they are willing to pay, the app will automatically cancel their order
4. The app will automatically recalculate the new delivery fee and automatically cancel orders that do not wish to pay the new delivery fee and order will only confirm if all remaining users are willing to pay for the final delivery fee (based on what they input initially)
5. 5 min before the stipulated order time, users whose maximum delivery price (what they input) do not meet the current delivery fee, will be notified, so that they may be able to amend their maximum price if they want.
6. Customers are able to cancel orders at the latest 10 min before order stipulated time.
7. After a order is confirmed, the users will be prompted to make a payment through GrabPay
8. The users will then be able to check their order status such as when a driver has been found, when food has been prepared/picked up
9. A page to view details about your past order, eg. date, price, food, etc.

# User stories

Our app will only be used by users who are ordering food delivery. The order will then be collated and ordered through GrabFood with the average delivery cost split between the users and added to their individual food price. They will then be directed to GrabFood for payment. Hence, other parties like delivery drivers or restaurant owners will not be involved in this app.
